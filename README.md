## My personal website showing my shenanigans
- so far it am still building up on the geometries on the page, and it is not mobile friendly yet

### to-do list
1. add nested geometries, namely new shapes show up after clicking a single shape
2. change title fonts, and maybe add some animations
3. put more infos of me on there
4. after finishing the website, make it mobile-friendly
